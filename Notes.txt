	by the way, sdl image, sdl net, sdl ttf, sdl mixer are all separately added

	touchups on window class and how it handles window resizes or display changes

TODO:
	scene class which eventually calls SDL_RenderPresent
	variable simulation speed by simply specifying a multiplier, with 1.0f being normal speed, and 0.1f being "cool slow mo"
	you can modulate texture rgb values with SDL_SetTextureColorMod, http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/12_color_modulation/index.php
	use SDL_RenderCopyEx instead of the regular RenderCopy, which grants you stuff like rotation around an origin as well as flipping it
	the scene class should split up its staged textures into static ones like the player and ui, and then the "world" which gets translated around the player(thanks for teaching me the mvp matrices; opengl)
